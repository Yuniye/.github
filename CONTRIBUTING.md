Contributing to Yuniye
=======================

_tl;dr: join [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/yuniye/discussions), be [courteous](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), follow the steps below to set up a development environment; if you stick around and contribute._

Welcome
-------

We invite you to join the Yuniye team, which is made up of volunteers and sponsored folk alike!
There are many ways to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub, helping people
on our mailing lists, our chat channels, or on Stack Overflow, helping to triage, reproduce, or
fix bugs that people have filed, adding to our documentation,
doing outreach about Flutter, or helping out in any other way.

We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue
database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained
our trust and demonstrated a commitment to Yuniye.

We communicate primarily over [GitHub Dicussions](https://github.com/orgs/yuniye/discussions).

Before you get started, we encourage you to read these documents which describe some of our community norms:

1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This
   also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people
   to ask questions.

2. [Values](https://github.com/yuniye/yuniye/wiki/Values),
   which talks about what we care most about.

Helping out in the issue database
---------------------------------

Triage is the process of going through bug reports and determining if they are valid, finding out
how to reproduce them, catching duplicate reports, and generally making our issues list
useful for our engineers.

If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!

1. Read [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. If you're helping out
   with triage, you are representing the Yuniye team, and so you want to make sure to
   make a good impression!
   
2. Familiarize your self with discussions from our [#hackers-triage](https://github.com/orgs/yuniye/discussions/categories/hackers-triage) if any.

3. Submit a discussion under the [Hackers Triage](https://github.com/orgs/yuniye/discussions/categories/hackers-triage)
   Help out by trying to reproduce the problem and asking for people to
   provide enough details that you can reproduce the problem, pointing out duplicates,
   and so on. Chat on the #hackers-triage to let us know what you're up to!

4. Once you've been doing this for a while, someone will invite you to the Yuniye
   team on GitHub.


Quality Assurance
-----------------

One of the most useful tasks, closely related to triage, is finding and filing bug reports. Testing
beta releases, looking for regressions, creating test cases, adding to our test suites, and
other work along these lines can really drive the quality of the product up. Creating tests
that increase our test coverage, writing tests for issues others have filed, all these tasks
are really valuable contributions to open source projects.

If this interests you, you can jump in and submit bug reports without needing anyone's permission!
The [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/yuniye/discussions)
is a good place to talk about what you're doing. We're especially eager for QA testing when
we announce a beta release. See https://github.com/yuniye/yuniye/wiki/Quality-Assurance for
more details.

If you want to contribute test cases, you can also submit PRs. See the next section
for how to set up your development environment, or ask in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/yuniye/discussions).


Developing for Yuniye
----------------------

If you would prefer to write code, you may wish to start with our list of [good first contributions](https://github.com/yuniye/yuniye/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+contribution%22).

To develop for Yuniye, you will eventually need to become familiar
with our processes and conventions. This section lists the documents
that describe these methodologies. The following list is ordered: you
are strongly recommended to go through these documents in the order
presented.

Since Yuniye is developed 100% in The Rust Programming Language, all you need on to get started on your machine is Rust and it dependencies.


Outreach
--------

If your interests lie in the direction of developer relations and developer outreach,
whether advocating for Yuniye, answering questions in fora like
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yuniye?sort=Newest&filters=NoAnswers,NoAcceptedAnswer&edited=true)
or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/yuniye/new/?f=flair_name%3A%22OPEN%22),
or creating content for our documentation
or sites like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yuniye).
From there, you can describe what you're interested in doing, and go ahead and do it!
As others become familiar with your work, they may have feedback, be interested in
collaborating, or want to coordinate their efforts with yours.


API documentation
-----------------

Another great area to contribute in is sample code and API documentation. As our API docs are integrated into our source code, see the
"developing for Yuniye" section above for a guide on how to set up your developer environment.

To contribute API documentation, an excellent command of the English language is particularly helpful, as is a careful attention to detail.

In general, a really productive way to improve documentation is to use Yuniye and stop any time your have a question: find the answer, then
document the answer where you first looked for it.

We're especially eager to add sample code and diagrams to our API documentation. It can be a lot of fun
to create new diagrams for the API docs.


Releases
--------

If you are interested in participating in our release process, which may involve writing release notes and blog posts, coordinating the actual
generation of binaries, updating our release tooling, and other work of that nature, then reach out at divinenii.com/contact.


Social events in the contributor community
------------------------------------------

Finally, one area where you could have a lot of impact is in contributing to social interactions among the Yuniye contributor community itself.
This could take the form of organizing discussions on GitHub, or planning tech talks from contributors, for example.
If this is an area that is of interest to you, please use our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/yuniye/discussions) to connect.
